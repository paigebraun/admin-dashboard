# admin-dashboard
This project was created as part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course. The full dashboard design was used to demonstrate learned knowledge of CSS Grid.

I used grids for the majority of the design, however, I did incorporate Flex box in a few instances where it made more sense to use Flex.
